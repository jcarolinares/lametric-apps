# Spanish Coronavirus APP for Lametric time

A simple coronavirus APP for my Lametric time device

It scrapes the official information from the Spanish goverment and put it on
the device. Using the datadista repository https://github.com/datadista/datasets/blob/master/COVID%2019/nacional_covid19.csv

Based on the idea of "H" who did the first Lametric with global data
